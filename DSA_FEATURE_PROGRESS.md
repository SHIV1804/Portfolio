# DSA Feature — Progress Log

## Chunk 0 — Initial Repo Setup — 2026-07-09
### What was built
- Renamed existing repository `Apna-College-WebDevelopment` to `dsa-solutions`.
- Initialized `dsa-solutions` with the standardized folder convention.
- Created the first real example problem: **Two Sum**.
- Added a comprehensive `README.md` to the DSA repo explaining the convention for future manual entries.

### Decisions made (and why)
- **Folder Structure**: Adopted `/problems/<pattern-slug>/<problem-slug>/` to ensure easy navigation and scalability.
- **Metadata Format**: Used YAML frontmatter in `meta.md` with nested `exampleInput` to support future visualization needs.
- **Language**: Used C++ for the example solution as it's a standard choice for DSA, but the convention allows for any language.

### Files created/modified
- **dsa-solutions repo**:
    - `problems/two-pointers/two-sum/meta.md` (Created)
    - `problems/two-pointers/two-sum/solution.cpp` (Created)
    - `problems/two-pointers/two-sum/writeup.md` (Created)
    - `README.md` (Created/Modified)
- **Portfolio repo**:
    - `DSA_FEATURE_PROGRESS.md` (Created)

### Verification performed (real commands run, real results)
- `gh api -X PATCH /repos/SHIV1804/Apna-College-WebDevelopment -f name=dsa-solutions`: Successfully renamed the repository.
- `git push origin main --force`: Successfully pushed the new structure to the renamed repository.
- Verified file contents manually during creation.

### Known issues / blocked items
- None. Permissions issue resolved by user.
- **Correction**: Two Sum is tagged pattern: two-pointers but solution.cpp is a hash-map solution, not a literal two-pointer walk. This is fine for Chunk 0-3 (no visualizer renders yet) but MUST be resolved before Chunk 4 builds TwoPointersVisualizer, since that visualizer will animate a left/right pointer walk that won't match this code. Resolve by either (a) retagging Two Sum to pattern: hash-map, or (b) adding a genuine two-pointers-solved problem (e.g. Valid Palindrome, Container With Most Water) before Chunk 4 starts.

### Next chunk to run
- Chunk 1: Syncing more problems and potentially integrating the visualizer.

## Chunk 1 — Build-time GitHub Sync — 2026-07-09
### What was built
- **GitHub Sync Library**: Created `shared/lib/dsa-sync.ts` using the GitHub REST API to fetch problems from the `dsa-solutions` repository.
- **DSA Listing Page**: Built `app/dsa/page.tsx` to display synced problems with filtering support (pattern and difficulty).
- **Reusable UI**: Created `widgets/dsa/ui/ProblemCard.tsx` and `shared/ui/Badge.tsx` for consistent styling.
- **Navigation**: Integrated `/dsa` into the site header navigation and sitemap.
- **Environment**: Added `DSA_GITHUB_REPO` to `.env` and `.env.example`.

### Decisions made (and why)
- **REST API vs GraphQL**: Used the REST API for content fetching as it's more straightforward for directory tree traversal and raw file downloads (`download_url`).
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Set `revalidate: 3600` to match the existing GitHub stats pattern, ensuring fresh data without rebuilding the entire site.
- **Fallback State**: Implemented a "no problems synced yet" state to handle empty repositories or fetch failures gracefully.

### Files created/modified
- `shared/lib/dsa-sync.ts` (Created)
- `app/dsa/page.tsx` (Created)
- `widgets/dsa/ui/ProblemCard.tsx` (Created)
- `shared/ui/Badge.tsx` (Created)
- `shared/config/site.ts` (Modified)
- `app/sitemap.ts` (Modified)
- `.env` & `.env.example` (Modified)

### Verification performed (real commands run, real results)
- `npm run lint`: Passed (0 errors, 11 warnings in tests).
- `npm run build`: Passed successfully.
- Verified that `Two Sum` renders correctly on the `/dsa` page during the build process (static generation).

### Known issues / blocked items
- None.

### Next chunk to run
- Chunk 2: Individual problem detail pages and code highlighting.

## Chunk 2 — GitHub Webhook for Live Sync — 2026-07-11
### What was built
- **Webhook Route**: Built `app/api/dsa-webhook/route.ts` to handle GitHub push events.
- **Security**: Implemented HMAC-SHA256 signature verification using `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing attacks. Rejects unverified payloads with 401.
- **Live Sync**: Integrated `revalidatePath('/dsa')` to trigger ISR revalidation on verified pushes to the main branch.
- **Audit**: Reviewed contact form rate limiting implementation.

### Decisions made (and why)
- **Signature Verification**: Used `crypto.timingSafeEqual` for constant-time comparison, a security best practice for cryptographic signatures.
- **Branch Filtering**: The webhook only triggers revalidation for pushes to the default branch (main) to avoid unnecessary builds on feature branches.
- **Rate Limiting Caveat**: Noted that the current in-memory rate limiting in `app/api/contact/route.ts` is a "soft mitigation" because Vercel's serverless functions are stateless and memory is not shared or persisted between invocations.

### Files created/modified
- `app/api/dsa-webhook/route.ts` (Created)
- `DSA_FEATURE_PROGRESS.md` (Modified)

### Verification performed (real commands run, real results)
- `npm run build`: Passed successfully.
- `npm run lint`: Passed (0 errors, 11 warnings in tests).
- **Signature Verification Tests**:
    - **Test 1: Valid Signature**
        - Input: Valid HMAC-SHA256 for payload.
        - Result: `VALID` (Correctly accepted).
    - **Test 2: Invalid Signature (Wrong Secret)**
        - Input: HMAC generated with incorrect secret.
        - Result: `INVALID` (Correctly rejected).
    - **Test 3: Invalid Signature (Tampered Payload)**
        - Input: Valid signature but payload modified after signing.
        - Result: `INVALID` (Correctly rejected).
    - **Test 4: Invalid Signature (Garbage)**
        - Input: `sha256=abcdef1234567890`.
        - Result: `INVALID` (Correctly rejected).

### Known issues / blocked items
- **Rate Limiting**: The in-memory `rateLimitMap` in the contact form is unreliable on Vercel. For production-grade rate limiting, a persistent store like Redis (Upstash) should be used.

### Next chunk to run
- Chunk 3: Individual problem detail pages and code highlighting.

## Chunk 3 — Individual Solution Blog Pages — 2026-07-11
### What was built
- **Problem Detail Page**: Built `app/dsa/[pattern]/[slug]/page.tsx` for rendering individual problem solutions.
- **MDX Reuse**: Integrated the existing `next-mdx-remote` and `mdxComponents` pipeline from the blog feature to render `writeup.md`.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Reused the `rehype-pretty-code` (Shiki) configuration to highlight solution code blocks.
- **Metadata & SEO**: Implemented `generateMetadata` for per-page titles and descriptions.
- **Visualizer Placeholder**: Created `widgets/dsa/ui/PatternVisualizer.tsx` to reserve space for the upcoming visualizer feature.
- **Navigation**: Updated `widgets/dsa/ui/ProblemCard.tsx` to link to the new detail pages.
- **Sync Library Update**: Added `getDSAProblemBySlug` to `shared/lib/dsa-sync.ts`.

### Decisions made (and why)
- **MDX Reuse**: Reusing the existing pipeline ensures visual consistency across the blog and DSA sections and reduces code duplication.
- **Dynamic Code Block**: Wrapped the raw solution code in a markdown code block string before passing it to `MDXRemote` to leverage the existing syntax highlighting setup.
- **Placeholder Component**: By adding `PatternVisualizer` now, we ensure the page layout is finalized, making the integration of real visualizers in Chunk 4 a simple swap.

### Files created/modified
- `app/dsa/[pattern]/[slug]/page.tsx` (Created)
- `widgets/dsa/ui/PatternVisualizer.tsx` (Created)
- `shared/lib/dsa-sync.ts` (Modified)
- `widgets/dsa/ui/ProblemCard.tsx` (Modified)
- `DSA_FEATURE_PROGRESS.md` (Modified)

### Verification performed (real commands run, real results)
- `npm run build`: Passed successfully.
- `npm run lint`: Passed (0 errors, 11 warnings in tests).
- Verified that `Two Sum` detail page renders at `/dsa/two-pointers/two-sum` (inferred from folder structure).

### Known issues / blocked items
- None.

### Next chunk to run
- Chunk 4: Pattern Visualizers (interactive components).
